# Pantry Inventory
This was my entry for the Domo Internet of Things hack night (July 19, 2016)
It is a (really) simple inventory managment tool. The Python script reads from and writes to a Firebase database. 
Then Domo reads from Firebase and displays the current inventory and inventory history.

The script was written and demoed on a Raspberry Pi 3, but it could work in any internet-enabled Python environment.

Ideally, this system would have a better UI than this script. I'd like to use a touch screen combined with a barcode scanner, but
those were not available when I wrote this (and I had really limited time anyway).
